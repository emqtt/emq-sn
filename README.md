Load Plugin
-----------

```
./bin/emq_ctl plugins load emq_sn
```

## Client

### NOTE
- Topic ID is per-client, and will be cleared if client disconnected with broker or keep-alive failure is detected in broker.
- Please register your topics again each time connected with broker.



### Library

- https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt-sn.embedded-c/

sleeping device
-----------

PINGREQ must have a ClientId which is identical to the one in CONNECT message. Without ClientId, emq-sn will ignore such PINGREQ.


pre-defined topics
-----------

The mapping of a pre-defined topic id and topic name should be known inadvance by both client's application and gateway. We define this mapping info in emq_sn.conf file, and which shall be kept equivalent in all client's side.
